<strong>OverView:</strong> <br>
Fear Of Missing Out (aka FOMO) is social anxiety, which forces people to think that others are having fun or doing something interesting while the person with FOMO is somewhere else. FOMO is connected with Social Networks usage, but it also may interfere with any other human activity.
My goal was to interview people who may have experienced FOMO & to develop an app concept, which may help them to ease this fear. <br><br>

<strong>Gathering info (Research & interviews)</strong><br>
The research phase started with goggling secondary research sources. But later, I decided to look for RescueTime annual reports (cause I used their service before).<br>
Those reports had info about the user’s behaviour during working hours.<br>
RescueTime found out that both FOMO & messengers’ notification design has a huge impact on people’s productivity at work. That let to average 2 hours 48 minutes of productive time/day. <br><br>

<div class="mytextR"><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com">blog.rescuetime.com</a></div>

Since productivity at work often leads to people’s success & happiness, I decided to focus on this particular area. During interviews, though, I noticed that several participants expressed controversial thoughts like “At work, I spend 3 hours at YouTube picking up videos to run in the background and often stay overtime. But my surfing habits are 100% healthy”. They didn’t want to be associated with any “disorder”.<br><br>

<strong> <i>"91% of millennials claim that they have healthy relationships with tech. But 53% wake up at least once per night to check their phone.” </i></strong>
<div class="mytextR"><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/millennials/">Accel + qualtrics</a></div> <br>
The Millennial Study Most participants expressed similar ideas when they were asked about preferences. <br>
All interviewees responded that they would use apps that provide audio (podcasts, audiobooks, playlists) as an alternative to social media. They would also use a service that reminds them to take a break or a walk, but they would not use something that makes them do exercises. <br><br>
People are embarrassed to do work out in public, but they have no room to do them privately. <br>

<strong>Analyzing data </strong><br>
<strong>Personas</strong><br>
Persona helped me to combine patterns. I figured during interviews and express them more clearly.<br><br>

<div class="mytextstart">Frequent user of the app</div><br><br>

<strong>Storyboards</strong><br>
Storyboard meant to explain the context on which the app can be used.<br><br>
<center>

  <tr>
    <td>But it is very dificult for her to concentrate in the open space, when always something happens.</td>
    <td>So she louches the app, her only oportunity to focus and to listen to music and intresting content at the same time.</td>
    <td>Now she can easyl focus on her work.</td>

<strong>User Journey Map</strong><br>
The existing journey my persona would have to make in order to concentrate at work and use the app.<br><br>
<center><img src="images\portfolio\music\userjurney.jpg" width="700" height="700"></center>
<strong>User Flow Diagrams</strong><br>
I created a user flow for the steps and actions the user would have to take, in order to start the Player. In the proposed user flow i have reduced the process so that the users dont lose intrestin the service and get demotivated. <br><br>

<strong>Wireframes - Low-fi Prototyping</strong><br>
The idea was to help users concentrate or deal with boredom by providing them an alternative to social media.<br>
Users launch app and select 30 or 60 minutes sessions. App offers them podcasts, music, or audiobooks for that session and mutes notifications from all sources, except important.<br>
Afterward, the app offers to take a break or go for a walk.<br><br><br>

<strong>High Fidelity Design</strong><br>
Below you will find my final pages, I have annotated the main changes that i made and explained why. I have kept the blue buttons and i have added some more graphics.<br>

<strong>Final Thougths</strong><br>
It was a fun experience for me to design this app. The difficult part is how to make the app simple but yet visually appealing to user while not being too distracted.<br>
Next step, I want to add in the gamification elements to the app. I've thought thought about a space theme with a rocket circulating the timer. Each complete session will bring users to different planet and users can show their map of exploration with other users.
