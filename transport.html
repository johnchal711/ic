<strong>OverView:</strong> <br>
A Transportation booking system app with a fresh design and with a user-friendly interface following the latest design guidelines and improving overall usability and UI.<br><br>
<strong>The problem.</strong><br>
Currently, the users found it difficult with the way the app works, this makes it almost impossible to do a booking, also tourists that are visiting the country and try to take the bus, complain that it is impossible to use the application as it is at the moment as there is no option for the app to speak English.<br><br>
<strong>Goal</strong><br>
The goal for the project was to make it simple and easy to book a round trip on the mobile app. Improving this would be the foundation for a strong evolution of a diverse user base.<br><br>
<strong>Gathering info (Research & interviews)</strong><br>
To start, I tested the app by completing a roundtrip booking to get an updated scope of the problematic experience. My goal was to understand the challenges that users faced and learn the workarounds that were employed.<br>
I also conducted a competitive analysis of other well-established UK bus brands offering similar services to better understand how the existing challenges in this space that other users may incur.<br><br>
<strong>Problems i have found:</strong><br>

 &#10004; Users can’t figure out if they’ve selected the right trip details for their round trip tickets<br>
&#10004; Users cannot find where their bus route is.<br>
&#10004; Users would rather use the desktop site over the mobile app because they are enabled to see more features to assist with their trip selection.<br><br>

<strong>Analyzing data </strong><br>
<strong>Personas</strong><br>

I distilled my research down to personas that best represented the user group. I mapped out the user’s journey of our persona Demi while including her thoughts and feelings from the day. From this, I was able to visualize her biggest frustrations and hone in on a focal point within the problem space.

<strong>Storyboards</strong><br>
With the design requirements in mind, I began to ideate with a storyboard and sketches of user’s process of buying a ticket. The user ultimately valued urgency and the seating options to decide on the best trip selection.
User story: Book a long distance bus ticket with a low budget as a Univercity student. 
Storyboard: Demi is on a summer break vacation and wants to travel back to NYC to spend time with a friend to help with a project. She goes on her mobile phone to search for the best ticket deal.

<strong>User Journey Map</strong><br>
In the existing journey my persona would have to make a ticket booking.<br>

<strong>User Flow Diagrams</strong><br>
I created a user flow for the steps and actions the user would have to take, in order to start the booking process. In the proposed user flow I have reduced the process so that the users don't lose interest in the service and get demotivated. <br><p></p>

<strong>Wireframes - Low-fi Prototyping</strong><br>
Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of an app before visual design and content is added. In the ideation phase I created wireframes presenting 
information architecture of the future layout.
I sketched and crafted lo-fi wireframes for my user stories and tested the general usability for my personas, requiring users to execute the task of booking a trip ticket based on various needs.

<strong>High Fidelity Design</strong><br>
After a few rounds of user critiques, I moved on to creating high fidelity prototypes. I updated the visual design towards a minimal style to provide balance between the many user face options, and then created stronger distinctions in the visual hierarchy for the best communication.
Below you will find my final pages. I have kept the blue buttons and I have added some more graphics.<br>

<strong>Final Thougths</strong><br>
<strong>Results & impact</strong><br>
Whilst working on the wireframes and prototypes, i had a small usability testing sessions with 3 users, which resulted the following:<br>
<li>The problem of booking for my target users has improved.</li>
<li>The overall changes create a greater trustworthy environment.</li>
<li>All user groups feel like it is more fun to interact.</li>
<li>The users feel confident in making a booking.</li><br>
<strong>Interations </strong><br>
I started interacting from the moment I created my lo-fi wireframes, sketching ideas, showing them to users, and seeing what makes them happy or frustrated.<br>
One of my mistakes was not testing the redesign of the hi-fi prototype and checking the original app. I realized that the green color used for buttons doesn't pass the contrast checker. Therefore, I decided to go through my documentation again and amend all necessary elements.
