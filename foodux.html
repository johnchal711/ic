<strong>OverView:</strong> <br>
A restaurant wanted an online food ordering/delivery platform that delivers daily foods to people at their doorsteps. Their objective was to allow people to make quick and easy access to the restaurants across the country and place an order quickly. The application had to be of a single design, and with a user-friendly interface.<br> 
Food ordering apps are quite popular these days. <br><p></p>
<strong>The Task</strong><br>
The task was to create a product from scratch an online food order delivers for the people who want to order foods in the comfort of their home without wasting any valuable time, where users and delivery man both can track their order history and summary.<br><p></p>
<Strong>Design Process</Strong><br>
Research, UX Design, Wireframe, User Flow<br><p></p>
<strong>The problem.</strong><br>
The users reported during interviews that some orders were cancelled twice and the drivers won't even give updates unless you ask them to.
Some customers waited for an hour and then they were just told to cancel the order.
Users found it very difficult to change account information.
They used to contact customer services many times.
they were unable to add a phone number to their new account with a new email address.
Some of them have tried to register many times for a new account through Facebook and Google but the loading seems to be an eternity thought!
Then I tried to create an account without using any 3rd party app but I stuck at setting up my info.
As I clicked done, the app closed on its own.<br><p></p>
<strong>Solution</strong><br>
I decided to create a competing app were to make an order should be as simple as few clicks on a mobile device and it should be easy to understand and informative about the options and choices the users have.<br>
User can track their food delivery ma to deliver food at the doorstep and also delivery man can be located their customer's address by using real-time GPS and guides<br>

The user allows to change or modify their account information and also any time they can change their email, phone number according to their needs.<br>
Through user surveys, we have learned that users would like real-time order status updates. Design a way for customers to visualize order status and progress.<br><p></p>


<strong>Gathering info (Research & interviews)</strong><br>
The research phase started with googling competitor applications in Greece, in UK, and USA.  
Analyzing and comparing the content of their apps helped me to determine the direction of development for my application.<br>

Further, to build empathy with users, I started off with a set of casual interviews. <br>
This resulted in a preliminary set of requirements and creating User Personas.<br>

Interviews helped me to discover a list of main requests of the users:<br>

<li> Quality of the service</li>
<li> Good choice of listed restaurants</li>
<li>Delivery/Take away option</li>
<li>Price criterion</li>

Also, by reading User Reviews of competitor apps I was able to spot and evaluate problems that they were facing, so my design will be ahead for the competition.<br>

Then I did an analysis of colors, their perception, and influence. Green is a cool color that symbolizes nature and the natural world. Perhaps 
because of its strong associations with nature, green is often thought to represent tranquillity, Good Taste Researchers have also found that green can improve reading ability.<br>

<strong>Analyzing data </strong><br></center>
<strong>Personas</strong><br>
Personas are vital to the success of a product because they drive design decisions by taking common user needs and bring them to the forefront of planning before the design has actually started. <br>
Personas provide the team with a shared understanding of users in terms of goals  and capabilities <br><br>

<strong>Empathy Mapping</strong><br>
Empathy mapping allows us to put in users' minds and understand users better. It helped me a lot of identifying the gaps between the users' needs and the current solution they are using.<br>

<strong>Pain Points</strong><br>
&#10004;The food items Price to much expensive<br>
&#10004;Unable tracking orders<br>
&#10004;Uncomfortable with the payment option <br>
&#10004;No support on forigin languages<br>
<strong>Gain Points</strong><br>
&#10004;Save money with daily special offers<br>
&#10004;User allows to tracking their orders by real time gps system<br>
&#10004;User can pay with a Credit card, Visa card, Paypal G Pay, Apple Pay with secure accuracy<br>
<br>
<p></p>
<strong>Storyboards</strong><br>
Storyboard meant to explain the context in which the app can be used.<br><br>

<strong>Wireframes - Low-fi Prototyping</strong><br>
Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of an app before visual design and content is added. In the ideation phase I created wireframes presenting information architecture of the future layout.<br><br>

<strong>High Fidelity Design</strong><br>

        <strong>Takeaway</strong><br>
              <p>Food delivery apps is not big news anymore, and this market will be more crowded and more competitive in the future. The important thing to stand out from competitors and this is not by recruiting more users. Instead, The valuable restaurants must bring loyal customers and increase customers satisfaction when they interface with the  platform, that can be more crucial in this market. However the delivery process in reality usually comes with a lot of uncertainty, so their tendency to cut off the communication actually cause users frustrated in their experience. This study wants to create an app that focuses on bringing value to the modern dining market and not building up a wall between users.</p>
